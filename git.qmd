## What is git?

Git is a version control system developed by Linus Torvald who is also the developer of the Linux OS. 
He claims to name all his software after himself.

Notes
  - At least conceptually git locally saves all copies of each file (as opposed to saving the changes = patches).

  
```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
